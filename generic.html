									<h1>This is my<br />
									Purple Rain Project</h1>
									<p>Our creative coding assignment was to create an improved Purple Rain simulation. The simulation is named after Prince’s Purple Rain song. 
										From Professor Daniel Shiffman’s code challenge, we created the JavaScript code in P5.js based on his Java program.

								<p>Added a surface

									There is a point where the raindrop strikes the surface. The surface height varies with position on the z axis.
									
									Added a splash mark
									We created a new splash class to create a visual splash effect, and added a splash member to the drop class. When the drop hits the surface the splash is initialized with the x, y and z coordinates of the drop. 
									The Splash mark is composed of diagonal lines with stroke weights and lengths depending on the z coordinate. Therefore, splashes further away will be smaller than rain splashes in the front.
									</p>
								<p>To add a depth perception effect into purple rain, rain falls slower and with less acceleration in the back. This creates an illusion of depth in a 2D scene.

									More distant drops fall more slowly
									
									The initial speed of the drop is mapped to the z coordinate. Closer drops fall faster.
									
									More distant drops accelerate less
									
									The acceleration of the drop is mapped to the z coordinate dependant on how close it is to the screen. The closer the drop is, the faster it accelerates towards the ground. Acceleration is getting added each time this.fall function is called. 
									</p>
									<p>Clouds have different heights so raindrops will have a different starting positions. Rain falls when it has accumulated enough which is another factor of variation. Therefore, rainfall will now grow progressively to the climax of the storm.

										Different heights
										
										When a drop is initialized or it hits the bottom the y coordinate is set to a random height between -50 and -500.
										
										Increasing Volume
										
										A drop is added once every ten frames until there are fifty drops. After that a drop is added every frame. After 500 drops the simulation resets.
