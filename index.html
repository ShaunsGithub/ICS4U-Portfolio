									<p><em>The video above is a project called "Make it Rain". I animated rain drops to repeat once they reach the bottom of the screen. Each rain drop has a random colour, height, width and position.</em></p>
									<p>The first khan academy module I worked on in the course was the intro to JS. This module involved basic animation by moving objects across the screen and drawing through shape commands.
										I will continue to use javascript on webpages to make the page more responsive for the user.

									<p><em><center>The image above is my cookbook made with HTML and CSS.</center></em></p>
									<p>The Intro to HTML/CSS on khan academy was one of the most intresting modules in my opinion. This module had you create two basic webpages: a place you would like to travel and a cookbook. 
										The aspect that had the most significant impact on me was how simple it was to create a basic webpage. I will continue to learn HTML and CSS because I believe it to be useful for an entreuprenuer to advertise themselves.

									<p><em><center>Here is my tribute page to Robert Kiyosaki the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad.</center></em></p>
									<p>In Basic HTML and HTML5, the free code camp introduction I felt was more helpful than khan academy's introduction. Free code camp had a tutorial on all the basics which you could return back to for reference.
										The project in this module was to create a tribute page while incorporating elements learned throughout the tutorial.

									<a href="https://snipboard.io/46UXwO.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="https://snipboard.io/46UXwO.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><em>This is my survey page, it allows user input to gain information about the user.</em></p>
									<p>In this module you worked on styling webpages. You learned the box model throughout the tutorial and how to munipulate it. However, in Khan academy you were quized with no experience of using this model.
										This course helped me understand the box model. I will continue to practice CSS to improve the style of my webpages and make it more appealing to visitors.

									<p><center><em></em></center></p>
									<p>Applied visual design added onto basic CSS by showing how to use colours and art to improve aesthetics of the webpage. This module was significant in helping beginners make their webpage more professional.
										I will continue using applied visual design in improving my webpages making them more usable and non-distracting.

										<h2><a href="#">Responsive Web Design<br />
										Principles</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://snipboard.io/1WYkxw.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="https://snipboard.io/1WYkxw.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Responsive Web Design was module which made the website viewable on multiple platforms. I believe this to be crucial for web developers because there are many different devices that are used to quickly access inforamtion
										such as phones. If your webpage does not adapt to this lower resolution display it will have lost out on many of its viewers. Therefore, I will continue using responsive web design.

									<p>Games and visualizations was a module focusing on refactoring existing, working games. In this I found it difficult to follow along. Often information was not clearly explained and I would need to research functions myself.
										JavaScript had so many libraries and built in frameworks it was diffuclt to know which ones would help me. I will continue to gain an understanding of JavaScript so I can better refactor JavaScript programs in the future.

									<p>This module worked on creating simulations that are common in nature. Averages in real life such as height of humans are covered in this module. Complex math and relations is used in this module which I had not learned in 
										my courses of math and science. I am continuing to learn these math functions so I will better be able to simulate nature in the future.

									<a href="https://www.rff.com/flowchart_title_key.png" class="image fit"><img src="https://www.rff.com/flowchart_title_key.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Programming involved looking at psuedocode and being quized constantly on it. This module covered the basics of programming: variable types, operations, storing variables, loops and conditionals.
										This module worked on explaining concepts of how a computer works through code and I will continue to learn programming in the future.

									<p>The first module worked on in the semester was learning to learn. In this module we completed a presentation on why it is important to study and what effects it has on you later in life. In mathematics and computer science studying
										is required to truly understand concepts. I will continue to invest my time into computer science so I can get my time back later once I suceed.
