										<h2><a href="#">Intro to JS:<br />
										Drawing and Animation</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IQ3HSxa88pPzcOEnUvtCYoeBWWgYlEdq/preview" width="400" height="480"></iframe></iframe></a>
									<p>The first khan academy module I worked on in the course was the intro to JS. This module involved basic animation by making objects move across the screen and drawing through creating shapes.
										I will continue to use javascript on webpages to make the page more responsive for the user.

										<h2><a href="#">Intro to HTML/CSS:<br />
										Making webpages</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="https://snipboard.io/oBhqcG.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Intro to HTML/CSS on khan academy was one of the most intresting modules in my opinion. This module had you create two basic webpages: a place you would like to travel and a cookbook. 
										The aspect that had the most significant impact on me was how simple it was to create a basic webpage. I will continue to learn HTML and CSS because I believe it to be useful for an entreuprenuer to advertise themselves.

										<h2><a href="#">Basic HTML and HTML5<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In Basic HTML and HTML5 the free code camp version of the introduction I felt was more helpful than khan academy. Free code camp had a tutorial on all the basic functions where you could return back to for reference.
										The project in this module is to create a tribute page with all the elements the instructions say to incorporate.

										<h2><a href="#">Basic CSS<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this module you worked on styling the HTML. You learned the box model throughout the tutorial and how to munipulate it unlike in khan academy where you were quized with no experience of using this model.
										This course was able to help me understand the box model. I will continue to practice CSS to improve the style of my webpages and make it more appealing to visitors.

										<h2><a href="#">Applied Visual<br />
										Design</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Applied visual design added onto basic CSS by showing how to use colours and art to improve aesthetics of the webpage. This module was significant in helping beginners make their webpage more professional.
										I will continue using applied visual design in improving my webpages making them more usable and non-distracting.

										<h2><a href="#">Responsive Web Design<br />
										Principles</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Responsive Web Design was module which made the website viewable on multiple platforms. I believe this to be crucial for web developers because there are many different devices that are used to quickly access inforamtion
										such as phones. If your webpage does not adapt to this lower resolution display it will have lost out on many of its viewers. Therefore, I will continue using responsive web design.

										<h2><a href="#">Advanced JS:<br />
										Games and Visualizations</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Games and visualizations was a module focusing on refactoring existing, working games. In this I found it difficult to follow along. Often information was not clearly explained and I would need to research functions myself.
										JavaScript had so many libraries and built in frameworks it was diffuclt to know which ones would help me. I will continue to gain an understanding of JavaScript so I can better refactor JavaScript programs in the future.

										<h2><a href="#">Advanced JS:<br />
										Natural Simulations</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This module worked on creating simulations that are common in nature. Averages in real life such as height of humans are covered in this module. Complex math and relations is used in this module which I had not learned in 
										my courses of math and science. I am continuing to learn these math functions so I will better be able to simulate nature in the future.

										<h2><a href="#">Programming<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Programming involved looking at psuedocode and being quized constantly on it. This module covered the basics of programming: variable types, operations, storing variables, loops and conditionals.
										This module worked on explaining concepts of how a computer works through code and I will continue to learn programming in the future.

										<h2><a href="#">Learning to Learn</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The first module worked on in the semester was learning to learn. In this module we completed a presentation on why it is important to study and what effects it has on you later in life. In mathematics and computer science studying
										is required to truly understand concepts. I will continue to invest my time into computer science so I can get my time back later once I suceed.
